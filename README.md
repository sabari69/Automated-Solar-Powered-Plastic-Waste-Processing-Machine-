# Automated Solar-Powered Plastic Waste Processing Machine

## Overview
This project proposes an automated machine for processing plastic waste using
mechanical crushing combined with chemical-assisted treatment. The system is
designed to reduce plastic pollution and support environmental sustainability
by minimizing air, soil, and land pollution.

## Process Description
The machine works in multiple stages to handle plastic waste efficiently:

### 1. Plastic Separation
Plastic waste is first separated based on type and size using sensors.
This improves processing efficiency and safety.

### 2. Mechanical Cutting
Separated plastics are mechanically cut into small pieces using a
low-power crushing and cutting mechanism.

### 3. Chemical-Assisted Treatment
The cut plastic pieces are placed into a controlled chemical treatment chamber.
Chemicals are used to weaken or soften the plastic structure over time.
This process may take several weeks or months depending on the plastic type.

*Chemicals are used only for controlled pre-treatment and not for direct
crushing.*

### 4. Final Mechanical Crushing
After chemical treatment, the weakened plastic is crushed easily using
a mechanical crusher with reduced energy consumption.
